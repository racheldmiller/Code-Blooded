So you're interested in becoming a dev. So am I ! I decided to track my journey so far, as well as links to resources I found helpful.

## My Story

TLDR; I'm a recent college grad who wants to become a dev, despite not having a CS degree.

<details>
At 18, I felt lost. All of my friends had linear paths for what they wanted to major in, and I was far from that. I chose to major in something practical (English), and I wanted to have more time discovering and exploring my interests. I explored the medical field and legal. My first job right out of college was at a tech company.

## Why Technology

Tech is welcoming of people of all different backgrounds. They value diversity because it provides different perspectives, which, in turn, enriches the environment. As for developers, I admire how resourceful they are, and they're able to think creatively to solve issues. I feel like these are transferrable skills from any field, but developers think in a way that I'm not used to doing... and that intrigues me. I always felt like in order to become a software engineer, you had to have gotten a CS degree. However, I learned that as long as you learn how to code, the CS degree is negligible. I am so thankful that companies will hire people who are self-taught.

## My Approach to Learning

Definitely visual. I'm used to things making sense to me right away, so I'm here to say I've definitely met my match with coding.

## Imposter Syndrome

I recently completed a 6 month coding boot camp. The imposter syndrome never left, and admittedly, I still compare myself to my peers. My instructor told me to stop. Don't compare yourself to others; you're right where you need to be. Plus, by taking the initative to learn these concepts, you've already grown so much from the day before. Trust the process.

## Pros and Cons of a Coding Boot Camp

I know myself well enough to know I needed to be taught in-person.
