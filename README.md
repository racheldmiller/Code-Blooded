# Code-Blooded

Hello, world! I'm writing this document for those who are people who don't come from a Computer Science background background, but are interested in transitioning into the world of development. I'll preface this by saying I started my journey Mar. 2019. So as of right now, I can't attest to anything, but hopefully if you're reading this and this resonates with you, you can take comfort knowing you're not alone! I decided to track my journey, as well as link to resources I found helpful thus far.

## My Story

<details>
<summary>TLDR: A recent college grad who's ready for a change!</summary>
At 18, I felt lost. All of my friends had linear paths for what they wanted to major in, and I was far from that. I chose to major in English, which I felt was very practical. All the while, I wanted to have more time discovering and exploring my interests. I've explored the medical and fields. When I graduated college, I landed a job at a tech company, and I was instantly enamored by everything. I knew that this was something I wanted to pursue more seriously. If I'm already at a tech company, why not expand my skillset and challenge myself to learn something more... technical?

## Why Technology

Tech is welcoming of people of all different backgrounds. They value diversity because it provides different perspectives, which, in turn, enriches the environment. As for developers, I admire how resourceful they are; they're able to think creatively to solve issues. I feel like these are transferrable skills from any field, but developers think in a way that I'm not used to doing... and that intrigues me. I always felt like in order to become a software engineer, as a prerequisite, you need to have a CS degree. However I learned that the thirst for knowledge, innovation, and collaboration are invaluable. I am so thankful that companies out there who will hire people who are self-taught.

## My Approach to Learning

I would say I'm definitely a visual learner. One of my biggest hurdles so far is my mentality. I'm used to concepts making sense to me right away, so I'm here to say I've definitely met my match with coding.

## Imposter Syndrome

<details>
<summary>Oh, it's real.</summary>
I recently completed a 6 month coding boot camp. The imposter syndrome never quite left, and admittedly, I still compare myself to my peers. My instructor gave me this word of wisdom: **"STOP!"** Ok, well he had more to say. "Don't compare yourself to others; you're right where you need to be. You've already grown so much from the day before. Trust the process." It's tough when your peers seem to apply concepts better than you. No one wants to feel like they're the slow one, or the weak link in a group project. I have to constantly remind myself that my instructor *is* right. One day, everything will click. And even then, we're still constantly learning and adapting to all the newest technologies. So the process never really ends... enjoy the ride!

## Pros and Cons of an In-Person Coding Boot Camp

### PROS (It outweighs the cons!)

- [ ] The ability to personally ask questions to your instructor or TAs in-person.
- [ ] Networking opportunities everywhere! You never know the connections your peers have, or your instructional team.
- [ ] Bigger sense of communuity. Everyone has similar goals in mind, and that fosters solidarity.
- [ ] Accountability and productivity. Having set deadlines on hw assignments/projects really motivates you to be on top of everything.
- [ ] (Theoretically), your boot camp is aware of what employers are looking in their employees.
- [ ] (Presumably), the boot camp also offers career services.

### CONS

- [ ] Circumstancial. Some people may not be able to devote x amount of hours a week to attend class.
- [ ] Deadlines for projects/homework may conflict with personal matters.
- [ ] Boot camps may not be financially feasible for everyone. (Luckily, there are some workarounds to this!)
